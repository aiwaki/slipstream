# Routing Research Notes

Updated: 2026-07-08

Purpose: keep a compact record of routing research, graph-tool status, and
safe follow-ups. This is an engineering note, not user-facing documentation.

## Findings Index

| Date | Topic | Status | Decision | Next action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-08 | Codebase graph MCP transport | Workaround active | Graph backend is healthy; use `codebase-memory-mcp cli` when the live MCP transport is stale. | Recheck native MCP tool after a new Codex session reloads tools. |
| 2026-07-08 | SonicDPI target identity | Reference only | Copy the principle of verified host/IP identity, not raw packet interception. | Use this when designing any future UDP/QUIC handling. |
| 2026-07-08 | Discord domain family | Partially adopted | Keep Discord on local bypass and cover the broad brand family. | Add only evidence-backed host expansions. |
| 2026-07-08 | Discord voice UDP | Future platform work | Full UDP handling needs packet-level filtering, not broad pf redirects. | Revisit under Network Extension or platform adapter work. |
| 2026-07-08 | Unblock-Pro connectivity probes | Adopted where safe | Use real Gateway WebSocket-style probing for Discord readiness. | Keep canaries autonomous and non-mutating. |
| 2026-07-08 | Unblock-Pro DNS/hosts/proxy mutations | Rejected | Do not mutate `/etc/hosts`, system DNS, system proxy, PAC, or external VPN configuration. | Detect and warn only. |
| 2026-07-08 | Install hygiene ideas | Backlog | Safe-copy and binary-format validation are useful for daemon install reliability. | Add install-time validation in a release-hardening PR. |

## Codebase Graph

- Observed on 2026-07-08: the configured `mcp__codebase_memory_mcp` tool failed
  in the active Codex session with `Transport closed`.
- The graph backend itself is healthy. `codebase-memory-mcp cli list_projects`
  works, and manual JSON-RPC over stdio works for `initialize`, `tools/list`,
  and `tools/call list_projects`.
- `/Users/aiwaki/.codex/config.toml` now sets `CBM_LOG_LEVEL=error` for
  `codebase-memory-mcp`.
- `/Users/aiwaki/.local/bin/codebase-memory-mcp` is a wrapper that forces
  `CBM_LOG_LEVEL=error` and executes the original binary at
  `/Users/aiwaki/.local/bin/codebase-memory-mcp.bin`.
- The active Codex session appeared to keep a stale failed MCP transport and did
  not invoke the wrapper. Until a session reloads tools, use
  `codebase-memory-mcp cli` as the graph-backed discovery path.

## SonicDPI Findings

- The most useful idea is cautious target identity, not a direct strategy copy.
  SonicDPI classifies by TLS SNI, verified QUIC destination, Discord voice
  packet shape, IP-prefix fallback, and sticky flow inheritance.
- SonicDPI explicitly avoids treating every UDP/443 QUIC Initial as YouTube.
  It only upgrades QUIC to YouTube when the destination is verified by prefix
  or DNS evidence. This matches Slipstream's rule: no global UDP/443 handling.
- SonicDPI's default target set covers a broad Discord domain family, including
  updater, status, CDN, auxiliary brand domains, and `discord.media`.
- SonicDPI covers Discord voice UDP ranges `19294-19344` and `50000-50100`.
  That depends on packet-level filtering. It should not be copied into
  Slipstream as a broad pf redirect.
- SonicDPI's QUIC fake Initial and Discord voice fake payloads are randomized.
  This is useful future research only if Slipstream starts touching those
  packet classes directly.
- The macOS Network Extension path is the right long-term shape for full
  UDP/voice handling on Apple platforms. It is not a small change to the current
  pf/TCP daemon.

## Unblock-Pro Findings

- The useful connectivity probe is a real Discord Gateway WebSocket handshake
  against `gateway.discord.gg`. Slipstream already has an equivalent payload
  canary.
- Flowseal-style rules include Discord voice UDP ranges and `discord.media`
  alternate TCP ports `2053,2083,2087,2096,8443`. These are useful references,
  but should only be used with host/IP evidence. No global alternate-port
  capture.
- `safe-copy` and binary-format checks are useful for release/install hygiene:
  retry locked files, skip identical files, and validate Mach-O headers before
  installing local binaries.
- GitHub mirror URL fallback could help updater reliability, but only as an
  app-owned download fallback. It must not mutate global proxy, DNS, or VPN
  settings.
- Do not copy Unblock-Pro's `/etc/hosts`, system DNS, or system proxy mutation
  behavior into Slipstream.

## Transfer Backlog

Safe candidates:

- Keep policy tests for the broad Discord family and every Discord host on
  `local_bypass`.
- Add narrow YouTube-family policy coverage for `youtu.be` and `ggpht.com`.
  Broader Google domains such as `googleapis.com` and `googleusercontent.com`
  need observed evidence before they join local bypass.
- Use a fresh WebSocket nonce in the Discord Gateway canary.
- Add install-time validation for bundled daemon binaries before replacement.
- Consider a signed remote policy/strategy update format.
- Keep external DNS, VPN, PAC, and proxy settings read-only: detect and warn,
  never rewrite.

Unsafe candidates:

- Routing Discord or YouTube through Geph.
- Global QUIC/UDP blocking.
- Global alternate-port capture without verified host/IP ownership.
- Mutating `/etc/hosts`.
- Rewriting system DNS, system proxy, PAC, or external VPN configuration.
