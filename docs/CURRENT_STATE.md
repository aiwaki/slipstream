# Current Project State

This is Slipstream's compact continuation checkpoint. It exists so a resumed or
automatically compacted agent does not reconstruct project state from the last
chat message, an old summary, or a milestone name alone.

The checkpoint is a locator, not authority. Repository state, merged PRs,
required CI, and current source code always win when they disagree with this
file.

Last evidence audit: 2026-07-18, through main commit
`6774340de8cc12c9e4874ba24a7ebe8c1f4295d4` after merged
[PR #154](https://github.com/aiwaki/slipstream/pull/154) and its successful
exact-main CI and dependency-audit runs linked below.
Live PR and `main` state still take precedence over this recorded evidence
boundary.

## Resume Protocol

Before continuing existing work, including after context compaction or a bare
"continue" request:

1. Inspect the current worktree, branch, HEAD, and remote tracking state.
2. Inspect open and recently merged PRs plus the required CI jobs for the
   current HEAD.
3. Read this file, [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md), and
   [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).
4. If commits landed after the evidence audit, inspect their diff and update
   the checkpoint before relying on its milestone labels.
5. Derive the next action from a concrete missing invariant or gate. Do not
   accept a milestone number from conversation or an old compaction summary as
   proof.
6. Prefer taking the verified action over repeating the roadmap. Update this
   file in the same PR whenever the milestone status or next action changes.

## Verified Checkpoint

| Milestone | Status | Evidence and remaining gap |
|---|---|---|
| M0 - Safe Base | CI-qualified | Private-anchor lifecycle, owned PF tokens, exact process identity, protected secrets, and script/packaged lifecycle CI are implemented. PR #133 removed the final production path that reloaded `/etc/pf.conf` from guessed legacy evidence. Daemon shutdown now blocks new status publication and serializes final status cleanup with any in-flight writer, preventing stale `active` state after the private anchor is cleared. |
| M1 - Autonomous Routing V1 | Partial | Runtime recovery, tray-independent owned Geph, browser restart, wake/network simulation, and deterministic traffic contracts exist. The protected `owned-geph-qualification` workflow has no passing run, and a physical default-route/lid-close transition on a disposable Mac is still unverified. |
| M2 - Contracts And Code | Partial | `slipstream-core` now owns policy classification, recovery, StatusV2, route-policy manifests and bundles, plus activation and rollback reducers. Python executes signed policy activation through that contract. Python PF/Geph orchestration and Rust tray runtime, installer, summary, and menu orchestration remain coupled. |
| M3 - Release-Grade macOS | Partial | Pinned dependencies, strict Clippy, explicit target, SBOM, manifest, audit, attestations, and preview releases are implemented. Stable publication is intentionally closed until Developer ID signing, hardened runtime, notarization, stapling, key custody, and rollback qualification exist. |
| M4 - Cross-Platform Core | Windows production host CI-qualified; pure data-plane contract implemented | `crates/slipstream-core` owns the pure routing, recovery, StatusV2, signed-policy, and activation models. `crates/slipstream-windows-adapter` executes every frozen routing/recovery vector and owns separate service-lifecycle, query-only observer, ownership-proof, payload, durable-state, action-specific SCM, single-lock native composition, command-wide controller, production host, and pure data-plane boundaries. The same no-network binary enters SCM mode only through exact `--service`; explicit management processes install its current content-addressed executable and produce versioned JSON results. Disposable Windows CI has qualified install, idempotent reinstall, stop, idempotent restop, start with PID replacement, idempotent restart, exact uninstall, bounded crash recovery, terminal cleanup, and post-commit compensation against a real service. Data-plane v1 now freezes request/session validation, first-payload versus terminal outcome semantics, adapter-owned resource closure, bounded cancellation, monotonic session identity, and bounded terminal retention through deterministic fake effects. Service-host/worker composition, native Windows networking, Android/Linux adapters, and the iOS feasibility gate remain. |

## Next Verified Action

Compose the production Windows service host with an injected no-network worker
through the frozen data-plane contract. SCM `RUNNING` must be reported only
after worker readiness, and stop or system shutdown must drive bounded session
cancellation before `STOPPED`. Prove startup failure, normal stop, forced
deadline, and late-completion behavior through deterministic effects and the
Windows SCM fixture. Do not add a native network API in that composition PR;
the first connector belongs only after host/worker lifecycle is qualified.

## External Gates

- Run the protected account-backed owned-Geph qualification successfully from
  `main`.
- Qualify a physical default-route change and lid-close/wake cycle on a
  disposable Mac.
- Add Developer ID signing, hardened runtime, notarization, stapling, policy-key
  custody, and cross-version rollback before opening the stable channel.
- The local Parallels Windows 11 ARM64 VM has minimal Rust 1.97.1 but no Windows
  SDK or Visual Studio Build Tools; native compilation therefore remains a CI
  gate until that disposable VM is provisioned deliberately. A Fedora VM is
  also available for the later Linux adapter.

## Update Rule

Keep this file short and current. A PR that closes a listed gap, changes the
next verified action, or adds a new release/safety gate must update this
checkpoint. If live evidence contradicts it, stop, investigate the difference,
and correct the file rather than improvising a narrative.
