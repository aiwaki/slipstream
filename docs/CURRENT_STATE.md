# Current Project State

## Verified Checkpoint

[Preview .24](https://github.com/aiwaki/slipstream/releases/tag/v0.1.9-preview.24)
is public from `e5791a4d7f42e000bb37732f8aa4b9698e62dd9f`, release ID 413914811.
All 12 public assets passed independent size/hash, signature, bundle, appcast and
remote-identity verification. Its exact-source CI38739537809, audit38739537827,
protected readiness38745936996 and publisher38752022135 passed. Readiness covered
8 Safari/Chrome cases and a measured 1800-second soak with clean teardown.
PR390 merged at `323a4df52215f169a64df96760dc9d8838d68a34`; CI/audit passed.
These unchanged release checks are reused. No workstation installation occurred.

Release evidence is retained in the `release-delivery` worktree under
`output/publish-preview24-e5791a4d7/public-verification/`.
Receipt SHA256: `1fc311510d89b6cbb975dcb5565fdb950b147f90208ab508523066f6d84f43fe`.

## Current Change

PR391 merged at `77ac92713760cd4996aa74204233889b7a77f8c6` after final-head
CI38768966095 / audit38768965965 passed. Its 14 updater tests and packaged checks
passed. Main CI38770908107 and audit38770908316 passed. The
pagination repair is not in the published `.23` or `.24` binaries.

The real public `.23 -> .24` attempt (run38763822390) stopped before activation
because no offer appeared; cleanup passed. Public upgrade/rollback remains
unqualified; use the published DMG. Evidence and separate source diagnosis are
in [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#a-new-version-notification-does-not-appear).

Current branch `codex/updater-daemon-identity` starts at merged PR391 in
`/Users/aiwaki/.codex/worktrees/readme-humanizer/slipstream-codebase-audit-20260905`.
It repairs pending-successor startup and daemon ACK identity. A mismatched
installed daemon must cause rollback before any privileged installer starts;
healthy status alone must not acknowledge the update. Privileged mutation stays
blocked until the watchdog finishes commit. This is a safe refusal boundary,
not coordinated application-and-daemon update support.

Rollback must retain compatibility with old clients and survive removal of the
active journal. Simply clearing the legacy transaction environment is unsafe:
the old client can see the watchdog lock and exit before cleanup. A separate
validated rollback receipt is used; no public pair is qualified.
No local Rust build or workstation mutation. Focused evidence goes in
`output/updater-daemon-identity/`; unchanged `.24` release checks are reused.

| Milestone | Current boundary |
|---|---|
| M0 - Safe Base | Candidate cleanup passed; public update/rollback unqualified. |
| M1 - Autonomous Routing V1 | Hosted browser/soak passed; no new workstation qualification. |
| M2 - Contracts And Code | Discovery fix merged; daemon ACK repair in progress. |
| M3 - Release-Grade macOS | Preview .24 public; stable and public updater gates open. |
| M4 - Cross-Platform Core | No new platform qualification in this change. |

## Next Verified Action

- Finish focused daemon-identity and rollback regressions, independent review,
  and exact-head CI in the current PR branch. Reuse main CI38770908107.
  Do not rebuild or republish `.24` or rerun its protected readiness.

## External Gates

- Repair pending-update daemon identity and privileged-installer lifetime before
  qualifying a future public updater pair. Preserve signed-install, rollback,
  notification and invisibility requirements; do not preinstall a new daemon to
  mask the defect or modify old published assets. See [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md).
- Stable publication still requires Developer ID signing, hardened runtime,
  notarization, stapling and the existing stable-channel gates.
- Native/source-owned work in PR384 and Telegram work in PR386 remain separate.
  Preserve the root checkout, user changes and all retained output.
- External DNS/proxy/PAC/VPN and PF owners are untouched. Discord, YouTube and
  Googlevideo remain on local bypass; this change affects no routing rule.

## Resume Protocol

Verify physical checkout, HEAD, PR state and exact matching CI once, then take
the next action. This checkpoint is a locator, not proof. Read [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md)
and [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md).

## Update Rule

Update this file when the verified next action changes. Keep detailed
investigations in their topic docs and retained evidence.
