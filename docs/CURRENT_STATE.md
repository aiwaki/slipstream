# Current Project State

This is Slipstream's compact continuation checkpoint. It exists so a resumed or
automatically compacted agent does not reconstruct project state from the last
chat message, an old summary, or a milestone name alone.

The checkpoint is a locator, not authority. Repository state, merged PRs,
required CI, and current source code always win when they disagree with this
file.

Last evidence audit: 2026-07-18, through main commit
`f3974fba27bde0e4dd932d86cf9a83c91b5831ab` after merged
[PR #157](https://github.com/aiwaki/slipstream/pull/157) and its successful
exact-main CI and dependency-audit runs linked below.
Live PR and `main` state still take precedence over this recorded evidence
boundary.

## Resume Protocol

Before continuing existing work, including after context compaction or a bare
"continue" request:

1. Inspect the current worktree, branch, HEAD, and remote tracking state.
2. Inspect open and recently merged PRs plus the required CI jobs for the
   current HEAD.
3. Read this file, [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md), and
   [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).
4. If commits landed after the evidence audit, inspect their diff and update
   the checkpoint before relying on its milestone labels.
5. Derive the next action from a concrete missing invariant or gate. Do not
   accept a milestone number from conversation or an old compaction summary as
   proof.
6. Prefer taking the verified action over repeating the roadmap. Update this
   file in the same PR whenever the milestone status or next action changes.

## Verified Checkpoint

| Milestone | Status | Evidence and remaining gap |
|---|---|---|
| M0 - Safe Base | CI-qualified | Private-anchor lifecycle, owned PF tokens, exact process identity, protected secrets, and script/packaged lifecycle CI are implemented. PR #133 removed the final production path that reloaded `/etc/pf.conf` from guessed legacy evidence. Daemon shutdown now blocks new status publication and serializes final status cleanup with any in-flight writer, preventing stale `active` state after the private anchor is cleared. |
| M1 - Autonomous Routing V1 | Partial | Runtime recovery, tray-independent owned Geph, browser restart, wake/network simulation, and deterministic traffic contracts exist. The protected `owned-geph-qualification` workflow has no passing run, and a physical default-route/lid-close transition on a disposable Mac is still unverified. |
| M2 - Contracts And Code | Partial | `slipstream-core` now owns policy classification, recovery, StatusV2, route-policy manifests and bundles, plus activation and rollback reducers. Python executes signed policy activation through that contract. Python PF/Geph orchestration and Rust tray runtime, installer, summary, and menu orchestration remain coupled. |
| M3 - Release-Grade macOS | Partial | Pinned dependencies, strict Clippy, explicit target, SBOM, manifest, audit, attestations, and preview releases are implemented. Stable publication is intentionally closed until Developer ID signing, hardened runtime, notarization, stapling, key custody, and rollback qualification exist. |
| M4 - Cross-Platform Core | First Windows owned-client relay in [PR #158](https://github.com/aiwaki/slipstream/pull/158) | `crates/slipstream-core` owns the pure routing, recovery, StatusV2, signed-policy, and activation models. `crates/slipstream-windows-adapter` executes every frozen routing/recovery vector and owns separate service-lifecycle, query-only observer, ownership-proof, payload, durable-state, action-specific SCM, single-lock native composition, command-wide controller, production host, data-plane, and worker-host boundaries. Disposable Windows CI has qualified the real service install/restart/uninstall lifecycle. Data-plane v1 freezes active-table host reclassification, failure-atomic effects with exact resume cursors, adapter-owned closure, bounded cancellation, monotonic session identity, and bounded terminal retention. Worker-host v1 gates SCM `RUNNING` on worker readiness, orders `STOP_PENDING` before bounded drain, permits `STOPPED` only after worker termination, and covers startup failure, deadline force-close, late completion, and mixed-effect recovery through deterministic vectors. The production host consumes it through an injected no-network effect, and PR #156 compiled and exercised that path against the real Windows SCM. Direct connector v1 in [PR #157](https://github.com/aiwaki/slipstream/pull/157) admits only an active-policy-validated direct session plus a canonical numeric endpoint, bounds socket ownership and all queues/deadlines, and maps connect/payload/reset/close/cancel/shutdown into the frozen reducer. Direct ingress v1 in PR #158 additionally binds fresh original-destination evidence and a non-cloneable owned client stream, reports payload only after delivery, and applies bounded backpressure in both directions. Production interception source, local/geo backends, Android/Linux adapters, and the iOS feasibility gate remain. |

## Next Verified Action

Qualify PR #158 direct ingress v1 on disposable Windows, then define the separate
capture-source contract that may supply one accepted client stream and fresh
original-destination evidence to it. Keep the production SCM host no-network
until that source has explicit ownership, shutdown, and compensation tests.
Do not choose a resolver, add local/geo backends, or expose installer UI inside
the relay boundary.

## External Gates

- Run the protected account-backed owned-Geph qualification successfully from
  `main`.
- Qualify a physical default-route change and lid-close/wake cycle on a
  disposable Mac.
- Add Developer ID signing, hardened runtime, notarization, stapling, policy-key
  custody, and cross-version rollback before opening the stable channel.
- The local Parallels Windows 11 ARM64 VM has minimal Rust 1.97.1 but no Windows
  SDK or Visual Studio Build Tools; native compilation therefore remains a CI
  gate until that disposable VM is provisioned deliberately. A Fedora VM is
  also available for the later Linux adapter.

## Update Rule

Keep this file short and current. A PR that closes a listed gap, changes the
next verified action, or adds a new release/safety gate must update this
checkpoint. If live evidence contradicts it, stop, investigate the difference,
and correct the file rather than improvising a narrative.
